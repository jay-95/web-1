	<p>In mathematics and computer science, an <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" target = "_blank">algorithm</a>(/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (About this soundlisten)) is a sequence of instructions
	, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation. 
	Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
	</p>
	<p>As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function.
	Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. 
	The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.
